----------

Griddle is a simple grid Component for use with React. It depends on [underscore.js](http://underscorejs.org/) and [React](http://facebook.github.io/react/).

Please check out the [documentation and examples](http://dynamictyped.github.io/Griddle).

To use Griddle:

`npm install griddle-react`

***Or***

download and reference griddle.js from the build directory (npm is preferred).

----------

To run from source, type the following commands into a terminal:

1. `npm install -g grunt-cli` if you don't have grunt.
2. `npm install`
3. `grunt`
4. That's it!

----------

Griddle is not yet version 1. There are likely some areas that will change and some issues that you may encounter. Please submit issues / pull requests for anything you run into.

###Changelog:###

0.3.0

- Pulling the React 0.14 update into a larger version update to prevent npm from assuming it's safe to update.

0.2.16

- Reverted to prevent an auto-upgrade to React 0.14.

0.2.15

- Upgrade to React 0.14 - big thanks to Sajin Shrestha (@sajinshrestha) on nearly single-handedly taking on this effort!

0.2.13
- Numerous bug fixes, additions.
- Additional notes will be added soon.
...

0.2.1 - 0.2.3
- Tweaks surrounding package.json dependencies.

0.2.0

1. __Styling__ - Griddle now renders as a single HTML table by default. Additionally, if you don't want to use Griddle's styles they can be turned off with a property `useGriddleStyles={false}`. [See more on styling](http://dynamictyped.github.io/Griddle/styling.html).
1. __External Results__ - External data should now be passed in via props rather than a callback. The Griddle callback is still available for those that wish to use it but it's now in a separate module. [More on External Data](http://dynamictyped.github.io/Griddle/externalData.html)
1. __Custom Components__ - In addition to swapping out the column or row with a custom component, it's now possible to switch out the entire grid with a custom component. For example, the data could initially be rendered as a chart. The data that makes up the chart could be displayed by clicking on settings and unchecking the `Enable Custom Formatting` option. [Customization docs](http://dynamictyped.github.io/Griddle/customization.html#custom-grid-format)
1. __Infinite Scrolling__ - Infinite scrolling can be toggled instead of the default pagination. [View infinite scrolling docs](http://dynamictyped.github.io/Griddle/infiniteScroll.html)  
1. __New Documentation Site__ - The documentation site is a bit more thorough and no longer a single page. [Check it out here](http://dynamictyped.github.io/Griddle)

__Breaking Changes:__

1. Updated the following properties:
 - **useCustomFormat** changed to **useCustomRowComponent**
 - **useCustomPager** changed to **useCustomPagerComponent**
 - **customFormat** changed to **customRowComponent**
 - **customPager** changed to **customPagerComponent**
 - **customFormatClassName** changed to **customRowComponentClassName**
 - **allowToggleCustom** to **enableToggleCustom**
 - **customNoData** changed to **customNoDataComponent**
 - *Significantly* changed **getExternalResults**. See the note below.
2. The **getExternalResults** property and loading data from an external source has been updated quite a bit.
 - Rather than exposing a single method to load data, a series of 'external' properties are available to pass data to Griddle.
 - For those that wish to use a callback and to support implementations before v0.2.0 using **getExternalResults** method, the `GriddleWithCallback` component was created. For more on GriddleWithCallback, [view the documentation here.](http://dynamictyped.github.io/Griddle/externalData.html#griddle-with-callback)
 - [Check out the entire external data documentation to read more.](http://dynamictyped.github.io/Griddle/externalData.html)
