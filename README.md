----------

Please check out the [documentation and examples](http://griddlegriddle.github.io/Griddle/).

TLDR: Griddle now has a customizable architecture that allows for one-off customizations or reusable plugins. These customization options allow for overriding everything from components, to internal datagrid state management, and more.

----------
To use Griddle:

`npm install griddle-react`

----------

To run from source:

1. `npm install`
2. `npm run storybook`

###Contributing:###

Please feel free submit any bugs. Any questions should go in the [Gitter chat](https://gitter.im/DynamicTyped/Griddle) channel or [stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/). Pull requests are welcome but if you have an idea please post as an issue first to make sure everyone is on the same-page (and to help avoid duplicate work). If you are looking to help out but don't know where to start, please take a look at [approved issues that don't have anyone assigned](https://github.com/GriddleGriddle/Griddle/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3Aapproved+no%3Aassignee).

We would love any help at all but want to call out the following things:
* Help maintaining 0.x
* More tests - we have a number of tests in version 1.0 but not quite where we'd like it to be
* More plugins
